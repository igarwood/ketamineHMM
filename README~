This directory models ketamine spectral data using a hidden markov model

ketamineAnalysis is the primary script which will 
- load spectral data
- estimate the HMM
- run the Viterbi algorithm
- (optional) plot figures
- (optional) save the estimated model

EEGanalysis is a second script which will perform a more paired-down 
analysis of a single human EEG file. It
- loads the spectrogram from a single human session 
- estimates an HMM
- outputs the most likely state path (according to 

Folders:
./data: contains the data for all figures presented in the manuscript
./plots: contains the functions to create all plots presented in the 
    manuscript
./plots/figures: contains scripts that will load the data and generate 
    each manuscript panel
./preprocessing: contains preprocessing utilities to load data, extract 
    time points, and calculate scaled power
./HMM: contains functions for estimating the HMM model, calculating model 
    likelihood, and the viterbi algorithm
./analysis: contains functions for analyzing the model parameters after a 
    model has been estimated
./analysis/beta_compare: contains functions and example scripts for 
    comparing beta distributions 
./analysis/duration_stats: contains functions and example scripts for 
    calculating duration statistics from an estimated HMM
./simulation: contains functions and example scripts for simulating a 
    spectrogram from a known markov model, estimating an HMM from that 
    spectrogram, and calculating accuracy measures; note that this analysis
    requires an estimated model as input
./model_output: where optionally saved HMM models will be stored
